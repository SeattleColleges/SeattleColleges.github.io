            "about": "The NSC Events web application allows users to view events hosted by the Student Leadership team and faculty at North Seattle College. Each event can be clicked to view more details about that event. Users can sign up and sign in for the application, which would give them access to certain features, such as adding their attendance to events. Users with certain roles, such as admins and creators, can also create, edit, delete, and archive events. In addition, admin users can also edit the roles of other users. NSC-Event's frontend application was built using NextJS and React. It leverages TypeScript and follows RESTful API principles. The server-side backend application was built using NestJS and was also written with TypeScript. Event data and user data is stored using a MongoDB database.",
